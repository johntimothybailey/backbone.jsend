Backbone JSend
==============
**Why**: If you are currently using Backbone in your front-end and [JSend][d] on your Service Layer, then this makes
integration into Backbone Models and Collections simple. If you are needing a common response from the Service Layer
and get more intelligent instructions from the Service Layer, then check out this project and [JSend][d]

## Usage ##

Assuming the urls as show below will respond with JSON and with the JSend Spec:

```javascript
var MainModel = Backbone.Model.extend({});

// Mixin to the model instance or Model "class" the JSend Response
_.extend(MainModel.prototype,Backbone.JSend.ResponseMixin);

var MainView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function(options){
    this.model = new MainModel;
    this.model.bind("error",function(){
      console.log("Error was dispatched from the model with ",arguments);
    });
    this.model.url = "/service/success";
    this.model.fetch({success:function(){
      console.log("using a success callback");
    }});
    this.model.url = "/service/error";
    this.model.fetch();
    this.model.url = "/service/doesntexist";
    this.model.fetch();
  }
});
var mainview = new MainView;
```
